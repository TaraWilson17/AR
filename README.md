### Simple AR application for office learning

This project leverages 2d numerical barcodes. It replaces these barcodes with images of office employees and of workstations as a demonstration to show how this technology could help people better understand the workspace. It could allow scanning to help employees better understand how a coworker fits into the organization or how to use open Agile spaces.
